# MeetPuppies

## Team members:
- Xiaoyu(Carlin) Huang

- Zhuohang(Skylar) Li

## Mobile App Introduction
### App Name:
**MeetPuppies**
### App introduction
The app is designed for the puppies and their owners to build socialised
relationships with others. Especially for the post-pandemic time, the app is aiming at
helping puppies to socialise, and recover from the isolated lifestyle.
Users will build the profile and also the profile for their puppies, and create events for
puppies to join.
- **Innovation**: we care about dogsâ€™ mental health and we also pay attention to security
issues( we will limit the event locations set to a public dog run, and enable an alert
function)
- **Elegant part**: we will give out badges for puppies that conveyed high-quality social
events with others.
